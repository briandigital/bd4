## Summary

As a product leader with well over a decade of experience addressing problems holistically, I create impactful experiences. By focusing on people’s context, needs, and tasks, I shape accessible and productive native and web-based applications. I hold an <abbr title="Master of Education Degree">M.Ed</abbr> in Instructional Design, and love working where design and learning intersect.

Outside of work, I moderate an active private Slack community of over 50 Boston-area web professionals, which I started in 2014. I am also an active volunteer in my community, having worked with conservation groups, youth sports, and the performing&nbsp;arts.

## Experience

### Lead Product Designer, Media Solutions, 
The Weather Company (formerly An IBM Business)
: May 2019–July 2025 (started as Senior UX Designer May ’19–April ’23)
: - 3-in-a-box leadership of multiple products for the media industry
: - Lead quarterly increases of NPS scores, 
: - Designed web-based and native Windows products generated tens of millions in renewed customer contracts annually.
: - Worked on cutting edge AI/ML products automating video production.

: Working at the edges of design and product management with a focus on design discovery and product requirements, I led collaboration with diverse roles and management across the organization to diagnose and solve the root problems users have. Work included product research, running workshops, creating traceable requirements, and UX specs, screens and prototypes, and mentoring more junior designers. I also advised other projects in other business units, which included native mobile products, in B2B2C and B2C markets. These products deliver timely weather forecasts to the general public across many types of media, including urgent severe weather alerts.


### Principal Designer, Founder 
Clarity & Hypertext
: January 2018–Present
: Brought my UX and Instructional Design expertise to remote and Boston-area teams as an independent designer, for web– and Apple-based products. I worked with small Mac developers, and on enterprise SaaS products for the healthcare industry.

### Director of Design & Technology
User Interface Engineering (UIE/Center Center. Inc.)
: October 2006–November 2017
: I designed and managed all of our web projects, and designed and deployed our information systems, working directly for Jared M. Spool.

: At UIE, I oversaw 9 years of event web sites, and the creation of the All You Can Learn user experience subscription library, from personas, scenarios and problem statements, to sketches, to development, to testing, and deployment. I managed more than a dozen collaborators, designers and developers. The sites and products I built have been responsible for millions in revenue, annually. I oversaw all company technology decisions, purchases, training and implementation.

: In eleven years with the company I also produced dozens of live virtual seminars, and built UIE's podcasting program from an experiment in 2006 into a program with tens of thousands of listeners. After I moved on to a primarily design role, the program continued on with well over 1.2 million downloads and its own full-time producer.
