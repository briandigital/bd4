## Experience

### Principal Designer, Founder

### Director of Design & Technology
User Interface Engineering (UIE/Center Center. Inc.)
: October 2006–November 2017
: I designed and managed all of our web projects, and design and deploy our information systems, working directly for Jared M. Spool.

: At UIE, I oversaw 9 years of event web sites, and the creation of the All You Can Learn user experience subscription library, from personas, scenarios and problem statements, to sketches, to development, to testing, and deployment. I managed more than a dozen collaborators, designers and developers. The sites and products I built have been responsible for millions in revenue, annually. I oversaw all company technology decisions, purchases, training and implementation.

: In eleven years with the company I also produced dozens of live virtual seminars, and built UIE's podcasting program from an experiment in 2006 into a program with tens of thousands of listeners. After I moved on to a primarily design role, the program continued on with well over 1.2 million downloads and its own full-time producer.
