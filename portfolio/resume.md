## Summary

Brian addresses problems holistically by focusing upon people's context, needs, tasks, and interactions that shape experiences with services or products. He specializes in designing with open web technologies, and is a proponent of accessible, progressively-enhanced, responsive web design. Brian holds a MEd. in Instructional Design, and loves working where design and learning intersect.

At UIE, he oversaw 9 years of event web sites, and the creation of the All You Can Learn user experience subscription library, from personas, scenarios and problem statements, to sketches, to development, to testing, and deployment. He managed more than a dozen collaborators, designers and developers. The sites he built have been responsible for millions in revenue, annually. Brian oversaw all company technology decisions, purchases, training and implementation. In eleven years with the company he also produced dozens of live virtual seminars, and built UIE's podcasting program from an experiment in 2006 into a program with tens of thousands of listeners. The program continued on with well over 1.2 million downloads and its own full-time producer.

In 2011, while he was full-time at UIE, he completed his MEd. in Instructional Design at night. Outside of work, Brian is an active volunteer in his community, working with conservation groups and coaching youth sports.
