## Professional Summary
I spent more than a decade designing and building sites and apps at CenterCentre/UIE for the most critical of audiences—other designers.

With a broad foundation of skills and experience, I consider myself a generalist in the field, able to play many different roles in a team. I work along side specialists, able to fill skill gaps between team members, while keeping an eye on the project holistically.

The skills I have used the most over the past decade of UX work include,

* Sketching and ideation, both solo, in small groups or leading team design studio workshops, including constructive critique.
* Working with different levels of stakeholders to determine their goals and needs in a project, able to translate between design or tech jargon, and plain English.
* Researching and interpreting customer or user needs from user research and usability tests, including drafting personas and scenarios.
* Prototyping in paper and digitally, I prefer to get to web-native/app-native prototypes quickly to work with reusable styles and patterns, but there are situations that call for different forms.
* Technically adept, I'm at home working side-by-side with developers of all types.
* Organizing and guiding specialist talent for the execution of the visual and development aspects of the project.
* Product manager in the broadest sense—building teams of coworkers and contractors, managing the design process, right down to managing version control and deployment, to running the QA process.
* I’ve mentored many interns, and love to teach. I even have a masters degree in Instructional Design.
