## Brian’s roles
* **Lead Product Designer and Generalist:** I managed a two-person design team and, when resources shifted, seamlessly transitioned to a hands-on generalist role.
* **Design Ownership:** I was responsible for all design duties, from UX research to UI execution, while running frequent customer input sessions to maintain project quality and velocity.
* **Product Management Collaboration:** 3-in-a-box product/project management (along with PM and lead dev)
* **Legacy and Innovation:** Balanced legacy infrastructure with use of latest tech
* **Prompt Engineering:** Prompt engineering for LLM content creation, including a complete rewrite of a 2,200-word prompt to increase reliability and conserve token use.

Meteorologists are under immense pressure to create timely, accurate, and hyper-local weather content for a growing number of platforms, including broadcast, web, and streaming services. The manual effort required to generate this content for each platform is a significant burden. ReelSphere was designed to solve this problem by automating the creation of scheduled, frequently published weather videos with live data, freeing up valuable time for "mets" to focus on forecasting and live on-air duties.

In version 1, users create stories from an existing library of [Max scenes](https://www.weathercompany.com/media/) and variables that are then scheduled to auto-publish. At publication time, ReelSphere dynamically chooses the appropriate scenes based on each location’s current weather data, updates the graphics, and adds a pre-written, descriptive text for each scene. These are the same top-quality insights used on TWC's weather.com and The Weather Channel apps. The script can be manually augmented or completely overwritten by a meteorologist and then synthesized with a customizable AI voice.

The earliest builds of version 1.1, shown to great acclaim at the 2025 National Association of Broadcasters conference, were still a work in progress. While I collaborated with our internal AI/ML team who built the generative script backend, a key issue remained: the LLM-generated scripts were inconsistent. I was responsible for a complete rewrite of the script-generating prompt, slimming it down from over 2,200 words to around 1,800 and applying best-practices for LLM prompting. This overhaul enabled the system to reliably create LLM-written scripts for each scene with a tunable style and tone.

With these features set to reach customers' soon, ReelSphere will empower meteorologists with a vital tool to serve the demands of modern media.
