It's 2018 and blogs are back, baby. Inspired by the [Indie Web Movement,](https://indieweb.org/) and looking to practice a little [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), I have dug deep and built a blog once more. 

This site will be a bit of a throw back, in a nod to bloggers like Jason Kottke, Dave Winer, John Gruber, Jim Darympleâ€¦ we'll have some of my core professional knowledge here. In my case that's talking about the web, design, and technology. But we'll also have my thoughts on other issues. I love to analyze things I've bought, and want to recommend to folks. So instead of leaving that writing on Amazon.com or some other site, I'm going to publish it here, first.

That's it for now. This should suffice for testing my system.
