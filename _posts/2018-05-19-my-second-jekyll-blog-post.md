I've got opinions and you're going to hear about them here. But first I have to finish building this site. And to build this site, I need to know what's on every page, and edit it until I'm at least not completely embarrassed at the content. Someone may actually come and look at it.

Perhaps I'll link to the other #webring sites from my amigos from Norâ€™easter Web.
