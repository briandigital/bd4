title: Returning to Now
---

After a pair of potential projects fell through at the very last moment this week‚Äîsome paper work was already signed! I found myself unexpectedly and **immediately available** for contract and consulting work. I realized much of my network may not have known I'd even gone out on my own. Mark that down under _strategic blunders_. I took to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/briandigital) today, with a few tweets to chart a new course. That looked like this‚Ä¶

‚Äî

I realize many of you started following me because I worked with Jared Spool and the other fine folks at UIE. Lately I haven't been using Twitter professionally, yet a great deal of my contacts come from here! Starting with this thread, I'd like to get back to some UX design. 1/5

‚Äî

Did you know I left UIE at the end of 2017 to become an independent UX design consultant and contractor? I've been loving helping Boston-area and remote teams tackle their challenges. 2/5

‚Äî

As a UX generalist I help define problems, craft personas and scenarios, develop IA, create sketches and wireframes. I handcode HTML/CSS, and am comfortable with digital prototyping. I really enjoy the center of the double diamond (img) 3/5 [^1]

‚Äî

You may not know also I have a Master's in Instructional Design, whose methods overlap UX a great deal. 1 recent project crossed the two, designing learning materials for software and their digital delivery. (I'm not seeking x-over projects exclusively, though.) 4/5

‚Äî

Now comes "the ask"‚Äîyou knew there'd be one, right?   
(FWIW, I don't really like "ask" as a noun, yet here we are.)   
Some unexpected, immediate availability opened up for me. Would you mind retweeting the next tweet, to help me spread the word? üôèüèª   
5/5+‚Ä¶

‚Äî

Could you or anyone you know use some #UX design or #instructionaldesign contract or consulting help, remote or near Boston? I'd love to know learn about their challenges. You can see what I've been up to at [briandigital.com/portfolio](http://briandigital.com/portfolio)

_(end thread)_

When I built this site, I had the idea to implement a **Now** page [in the style of Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). But I pulled back, because well, this whole site is about what I'm doing now, right? I here to hang my shingle out, so people know I'm here to help them with their design challenges?

When turned to [my Twitter network](https://twitter.com/briandigital), where I built many of my connections I maintain today, I realized I hadn't been talking about what I've been up to recently, and I needed to get the word out‚Ä¶ now. So this is my "Now" blog post.
