A weblog and portfolio site for Brian Christiansen, a UX and Instructional Designer from New England. This site's code builds upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Poole/Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), and [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/).

This is the fourth generation of my personal site, which was originally established in the year 2000.

This site is my first experiment with a Markdown-centric, fully version controlled,  "serverless" site.
