_Something-something witty about writing about himself in the third person. Perhaps a pun. And now welcome the new folks to the website…_

## Welcome!

Brian Christiansen is a father of three, husband of one, and …son of two? I've got a miniature schnauzer puppy—where does she fit into this bio? We all live tucked into the trees, north of Boston.

I make my living designing things, and you can read all about that in my [portfolio](/) and [résumé](/portfolio/resume), on this very site. If you want to talk about that, you can [email me](mailto:brian@briandigital.com).

Otherwise, I like to spend my time in the woods, either on a mountain or gravel bike, hiking, or camping. I keep a keen eye on trends in technology world, especially Apple, and education and ed-tech realm. I've been a musician since I was 10, and listed to range of genres. I drink tea, not coffee, and like to follow a wide variety of sports. I volunteer in my community, having coached youth soccer, basketball, baseball and softball, helped with a trails conservation group, and most recently as the CTO of the local music association.
