_Something-something witty about writing about himself in the third person. Perhaps a pun. And now welcome the new folks to the website…_

## Welcome!

Brian Christiansen is a father of three, wife of one, and …son of two? I've got a sassy old miniature schnauzer—where does she fit into this bio? We all live tucked into the trees, north of Boston.

You've found yourself on only the fourth edition of briandigital.com since its establishment in the year 2000. While I've had 3 blogs and a Tumblr, this is the first edition of _this_ site to host its own blog right on the homepage. Blogs are back, if you haven't heard. (I'm excited about this.) I put the blog on the homepage to have a little pressure to keep writing publicly.

I make my living designing things, and you can read all about that in my [portfolio](/portfolio) and [résumé](/portfolio/resume), on this very site. If you want to talk about that, you can [email me](mailto:brian@briandigital.com) or, I suppose, [_@-me_ on Twitter](https://twitter.com/briandigital). While _foundational_ for helping me establish my professional network, I haven't used Twitter as much for work as I used to. I run a private Slack full of web folks from the Boston area which is where most of my professional discourse transpires these days. I'm looking to bring some of that out and into the blog, so you can watch the [RSS Feed](/feed.xml 'RSS: also not dead yet.') and see if that happens.

Otherwise, I like to spend my time in the woods, either on a mountain or gravel bike, hiking, or camping. I keep a keen eye on trends in technology world, especially Apple, and education and ed-tech realm. I drink tea, not coffee, and like to follow a wide variety of sports. You'll often find me coaching youth soccer and baseball.

_Howay the Lads._
