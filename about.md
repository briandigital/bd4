_Something-something witty about writing about himself in the third person. Perhaps a pun. And now welcome the new folks to the website…_

## Welcome!

You've found yourself on only the fourth edition of briandigital.com since the year 2000. While I've had 3 blogs and a Tumblr elsewhere, this is the first edition of this site to host its own blog right on the homepage. Blogs are back, if you haven't heard. (I'm excited about this.) I guess I need to start writing, eh?

Brian Christiansen is a father of three, wife of one, and …son of two? I've got a sassy old miniature schnauzer—where does she fit into this bio?

I make my living designing things, and you can read lots about that in my [portfolio](/portfolio) and [résumé](/portfolio/resume), on this very site. If you want to talk about that, you can [email me](mailto:brian@briandigital.com) or, I suppose, [_@-me_ on Twitter](https://twitter.com/briandigital). While _foundational_ for helping me establish my professional network, I haven't used Twitter as much for work as I used to. I run a private Slack full of web folks from the Boston area which is where most of my professional discuss transpires these days. I'm looking to bring some of that out and into the blog, so you can watch the [RSS Feed](http://localhost:4000/feed.xml 'RSS: also not dead yet.') and see if that happens.

_Howay the Lads._
